A pet project to practice a few skills and learn some new things.

While I'm at the Interface/Flywheel WordPress school, I thought I'd spin up this site to practice a few skills and learn some new things.
The things I've incorporated are:

1. Git (duh, you're on GitHub, right?)
2. Sass (from the _s theme)

The things I want to work on are:

1. Converting this to WordPress
1. Using the _s theme as a base for a custom theme
2. Developing a plugin to handle the race results information, including:
  1. A data entry screen based on user role
  2. Being able to display the data on the front end
  3. Being able to sort, filter, and search that data from the front end
